Models
======

**My first vision of the project:** 

After read and study [C4 model](https://c4model.com/) concept, I wrote text that models this vision in three parts.

## System

## Container

[![Container](../C4-Model/img/Container.png)](../C4-Model/system/container/container.puml)

## Component

[![Component](../C4-Model/img/API.png)](../C4-Model/system/container/components/api-component.puml)

## Entities

I finish with the entities model
