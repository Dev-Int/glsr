This repository comes from ideas coming from [GLSR](https://github.com/Dev-Int/glsr), where, in 2020, I found myself 
 stuck on dependency updates, after several months of abandonment. At the same time, a friend of mine needed help with
 unit testing.
 
So I started with unit tests, then, along the way, I resumed the desire to develop my project. This one starts from
 scratch, only the entities will not change, to begin with. The domain is there. ðŸ˜‰

To train and create skills, I want to develop according to the DDD vision, and the different testing approaches
 (ATDD, TDD, BDD ...)
 
### Features

To start in the right direction, I start by preparing my [use cases](https://github.com/Dev-Int/tests/labels/use%20case),
 and adding the resulting tests after this list:

- [x] rewrite Domain model to check and correct my previous choices

- [ ] install [Behat](https://docs.behat.org/en/latest/quick_start.html)
