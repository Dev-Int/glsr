# Installation
--------------

## 1) Get the code

You have two ways to do so:

1) Via Git, cloning deposit;

2) Via downloading the source code in a ZIP archive, at this address: https://github.com/Dev-Int/glsr/archive/master.zip

## 2) Define your application settings

To not share all our passwords, file `app/config/parameters.yml` is ignored in this deposit. Instead, you have the file `parameters.yml.dist` that you must rename (remove the `.dist`) and modify.

## 3) Download vendors

With Composer, of course:

    php composer.phar install

## And enjoy!
