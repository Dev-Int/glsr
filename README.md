## Roadmap

To restart in the right direction, I start by preparing my use cases, and adding the resulting tests after this list:

- [x] rewrite [Domain model](docs/index.md) to check and correct my previous choices

- [x] install [Behat](https://docs.behat.org/en/latest/quick_start.html)

To follow the progress, visit the [use cases](https://github.com/Dev-Int/tests/labels/use%20case) page
- Settings the application (back âœ…) (front `in progress...`)
- Register a user (back âœ…) (front `in progress...`)
- Authentication (back âœ…) (front `in progress...`)

## History

In 2020, I found myself stuck on dependency updates, after several months of abandonment. There was a branch for recipes,
 a new branch for Symfony4, and nothing was progressing. At the same time, a friend of mine needed help with unit testing.
 
So I started on [Test](https://github.com/Dev-Int/tests) repository, with unit tests, then, along the way, I resumed the
 desire to develop my project. This one starts from scratch, only the entities will not change, to begin with. The domain
 is there. ðŸ˜‰

To train and create skills, I want to develop according to the DDD vision, and the different testing approaches
 (ATDD, TDD, BDD ...)
